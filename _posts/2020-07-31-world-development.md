My motivation to study Mathematics together with Economics started in high school. Back then, I thought the way we were looking at our evolution was inherently false. We continuously measure the health of world economies by defining the change in added production value or Gross Domestic Product (GDP). I believed, and still do, that setting goals with that measure would not help us in the long term. 

Thus, when it was time to choose the subject of my thesis, I set out to make a world classification of countries taking into account a broader view.
